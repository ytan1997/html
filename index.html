  <h1>The Art of War</h1>

  <h2>Sun Tzu</h2>

  <em>

  <p>'The wise warrior avoids the battle.'</p>

  </em>
<div class="center">
  <p>A classic book of military strategies, Sun Izu's
  The Art of War is about resolving conflicts and achieving
  peace. Often read as a book of war tactics, it is much more
  than that: it does not glorify war but simply presents the
  best ways to win one that has already been waged.
  Despite being rooted in military philosophy and wisdom,
  the relevance of Sun Tzu's work is not restricted in scope
  and time; its lessons about conflict, strategy and leadership
  remain applicable across ages, in all areas of life.</p>
